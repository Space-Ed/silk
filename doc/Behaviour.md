within the model of a graph linking sources to sinks there is a great rift abound

The distinction of the push and pull, for we have in our model we have removed the caller from the situation.
the caller was the very means to drive the computation of some other part of the code base.

Does the appearance of data drive the computation downstream the results which derive from this become new as this wave propogates forth until it reaches a final consumer.

OR

Does the requirement of data drive the computation upstream to produce this next moment, from various sources that a blended together from until the eventual updated

OR

Is each position within this system continuously pulling and pushing as those parts become needy or eager and the neediness and eagerness is propogated with the information.


Are these ways fundamentally incompatible with inherently irreconcilable behaviour?

OR

Can they both be operated simultaneously within the bounds of some specifiable behaviour

OR

Do they require special syntax to say which kind we are using for each kind of interaction.
