## Silk execution model

when you run ```silk``` in a directory we search therin for file named .silk,
this file is the spark of life from which all else is born.

our ultimate aim is to create a weave that binds together all means and ends
into a streamlined flow of information, which is adaptive to change and transparent to sight

__steps on the silk road__

1) parse
2) flatten
3) load
4) link
5) run

#### 1: Parse
beginning from the spark we travel to the ends of the earth, by following the references to other files \
seeking out all the bolts of material for our grand creation. \
In each place we visit we translate local tongues to find our way on this map of the world.

#### 2: Flatten
Once all the things have been found we do gather them hither to a single hall which holds each of those bolts under a unique name
all those collected will now refer to each other by these names.
the memory of a file recedes to the distant past

the form here is one that can be sent far to various platforms for the perfect empire

#### 3: Load

this step is sees us abide to the customs of the host platform, creating a model of the objects which will adhere to the silken way.
now we see those unique names give way to the decreed form of reference.

#### 4: Link

The points of connection between things are the contacts, a contact belongs to a cell which has an awareness of its surrounding space.
where I see my need and you express your means we will join by magin in union till one does leave or no longer wish to engage.

#### 5: Run

our world bursts to life and everything begins to flow like rivers to the ocean of a render or a crisscrossing path of the caravan.
