# The Dance of Symmettry and Distinction
# The nine concepts
# The Taxonomy of Systemiz

To create the most pleasing programming experience it is essential to consider the irreducable dualisms of information systems. These dualisms are to be kept in balance and harmony as the language and machinery is designed and as the programs are written and executed.

There count nine dualisms three in each of three categories.

# Dualisms of Form 
## representation - manifestation
whether it is data or real system, literal or interpreted

## inquisitive - definitive
it is a question or a statement

## space or entity
is it the context or the thing that occupies it.

# Dualisms of interaction
## In - Out
the direction of data flow. Whether we draw from source or feed to the sink of adjacent

## Push - Pull
The direction of execution, to push is to go with and to pull is to go against the flow of data.

## driver - incentive
it is either the active instigator of, or the passive reason for the executed act.

# Dualisms of Reference
## subject - object
whether it is looking out or being looked upon

## absolute - relative
the meaning of a term may depend on it's position in the system or be part of the global world it inhabits.

## anonymous - identifiable
there is an implicit, default and primary was and an explicit, nominal and auxilliary way.

_these concepts are transcribed into the language such that each can be engaged in isolation and in concert with each of the others therefore what follows is a description of how each form relates to each of these concepts in _

a context is a container for a value, an expression is one of 14 forms which may provide infinitely many a finite number or zero contexts. An expression will evaluate to a value which may be fixed to a context.

A context
- has input or output or both
- is a manifest or representative context
- can be a push or pull driver ( a )

## Metaphysics
The bi-dichotomy of substance

#### Axis 1: Nature: Subject and Object
  - Determinate existence is that of bodies, complex and simple, which are all objective creation. Write, Push, Positive, Yang, Synthesis
  - Experienced existence is that of minds, complex and simple which is the subjective awareness of all things. Read, Pull, Negative, Yin, Analysis
#### Axis 2: Mode: Manifest and Representative
  - Our reality, including it's composite parts of both Natures is actual and operational, including by extention all there is to see and touch.
  - Our ideality, the space of all values concievable, the platonic space of concepts according to all that may be created and experienced.


programming is the art of combining, and translating between the above aspects.

### A Language

silk has two categories of language expression, that belong to the analytic and synthetic facilities of the language.


One may consider this distinction as equivalent to the mind and body, one is tasked with experiencing and the other with enacting concrete change. The interplay of these elements is what drives computation and they are mutually dependent without objects to analyse cognition is useless and without recieving stimulus there is no way to produce appropriate responses.

__essential parts of program entities__
While treated as distinct natures with different syntactic possibility, both forms(indeed all forms) become a unified node type known as a cell. Cells have 3 features
- a pair of primary input and output ports
- any number of nominal input and output channels
- a pair of eyes to see the inputs and outputs of the surrounding context.

So usually the arguments and methods available to operate are defined by the header of the function/class. Here we determine what inputs and outputs appear on our cells simply by referring to them or that is implicit to the context.

__struct
in a construct whose primary output is the composed result, treats portal expressions as inputs that are sources of determination.

__visor__
in a visor whose primary input is the object to decompose, treats portal expressions as outputs that are sinks to disseminate.

__Chain__
in a series our primary input is at the beginning which flows through its child cells in sequence to it's end which is it's primary output.

the series must be explicit about it's inputs and outputs and may compatibilise by rebinding of channel names, channels that are opened at input will send forward in the sequence to the subcells that accept those channels as inputs and subcells that send on particular channels will be passed out where the output is openned

__On the common form of interfacess__
There is between these distinct forms a common abstract type which facilitates the transfer of information between points of a program, these nodes are called contacts, a contact is either an input or an output and can be downstream or upstream (respectively) from zero or more corresponding outputs and inputs.


Code is a representation of a process, such a process that may accept data as input and produce data as output. data is merely a process which has only one possilbe outcome, which is it's own representation. Therefore data is subset of code. Then what does code include? it includes the means to produce different results, depending on what input it is given.

There are two forms of composite, constructs and vacuums. A construct is positive, the force acting to define. A vacuum is negative, the force that seeks definition. The presence of both forms is what drives computation.

the treatment of output and input is symmetric. it is possible to seek a source to draw as much as it is a sink to put into.

data goes one way: from a fullness of data to a void of data. Therefore it is not neccessarily the way of the input to the output, if the input is itself a void.

you must decide what is literal and what is manifest, a process literal can be produced and provided as input, in order to be compiled to become a process it must manifest. To be manifest is to be attached in exactly one space. The attachment hierarchy carries to the absolute root and contains by extension all manifest processes. a literal can be interpreted as process or left as representation though eventually will become a primary representation in a terminal context, a string of characters in a console or pixel array of an image.

to determine how representations are treated there are a number of distinct natures which apply to a space and are determined by the use of keyword context modifiers.


How do we distill the essence of a system to it's most comprehensible and operable representation? This is the ultimate question and it hints at it's own solution. When we consider distilling the essence to be the compilation of code which is a representation of a system that is both comprehendig and operating.

at the heart of silk are a few important learnings, these are the fundamental design drivers that ultimately makes the tapesty flow nicely.
