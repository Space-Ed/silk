__A language of elegance where data flows are woven freely and expressively, where symettry and asymettry, push and pull are balanced and harmonized into an immaculate tapestry of forms.__

## Motivation

Programming is ugly, and this makes creating programs more arduous than it needs to be. Even the most hardcore lambda calculus touting languages have a shadow of deep lopsidedness about them. Silk is an attempt to create a programming language based on conceptual balance and neccessity. To many it will appear strange and esoteric, rather than beautiful. This is because it operates with a totally different set of constructs; for it's constructs like classes, functions, variables and for-loops that create asymettry and bias that ultimately causes us to write twisted intractable and verbose code. The world we see is one distorted by the concepts we are familiar with, though they may be ultimately arbitrary. This project is an attempt to create a language which challenges our ideas about programming, and although it may be another arbitrary stab based on one person's experiences and explorations it could well open some doors to real development in how we think about programs. Many languages have libraries with toolkits for streams, queries, asynchronicity, functional programming and other important tasks that should be more naturally expressed with the right syntactic forms. This is what this language will do and hence offers the prospect of compiling onto many target platforms.
